# keep_water_app

This mobile application will allow you to improve water consumption, it creates useful habits for the user, finds leaks, trains the user to use water most efficiently, predicts the user's water consumption and gamify the process of reasonable use of water.

This is still a prototype, so improvements must be done.

## Getting Started

This project was developed with Flutter, so you need to have it properly installed. To check if everything is working, run `flutter doctor`. For more information about Flutter see the [Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs).

### Running the App

Check if you have any emulators by writing `flutter emulators` on you command line.
To create a new emulator, you can install it on Android Studio or by running `flutter emulators --create [--name xyz]`

To run an emulator, run `flutter emulators --launch <emulator id>`.
To run and start the app, run `flutter run --no-sound-null-safety`.
