#### Our mobile application will allow you to improve water consumption, creates useful habits for the user, finds leaks, train user to use water most efficiently, predicts the user's water consumption and gamify the process of reasonable use of water.

### PROBLEM:
Increased water consumption. The lack of an application that trains the user to use water efficiently, optimizes the heating system, allows you to monitor your own consumption, finds leaks based on water consumption data, creates useful habits and predicts the user's water consumption.
There are also no solutions that gamify the process of reasonable use of water.

### DATA USAGE:
The application uses user data, similar users and statistics from various datasets. Using this data, we have created functions that will help people use water consciously.
• We used the collaborative filtration method, where the experience of a similar user is used to predict the user's water consumption.
• Training of the user based on the analysis of his water use and based on his data. That is, the user will receive relevant articles and tips.
• Based on the analysis of water flow, we can find a leak if we find abnormal data that goes beyond the standard deviation.

### EDUCATION AND VISUALITY:
The application has a user-friendly interface. The solution is convenient, practical, and easy to understand.
Minimize water waste smart and make this habits part of your life! We added habit tracker to help you bring this lifestyle through whole your life! keep.water will show you articles based on your data, they will help you waste smarter. 

### GAMIFICATION:
Gamification allows you to compete with friends and perform challenges within the framework of useful habits. You can: see how much water was used and how much your friends used, invite them to compete, perform challenges in the framework of healthy habits, for example, drink 2 liters of water a day or drink water instead of coffee.
We believe that user friendly interface will motivate you in friendship with water and make it easier.  

### REAL IMPACT ON THE WORLD:
The application will allow you to:
•	Reduce water consumption, respectively, and bills.
•	Finding leaks not only reduce consumption, but also simplify the work of plumbers.
•	Gamification will motivate the user to use water rationally and involve other people in this process.
•	Train the user to use water correctly and show a reasonable amount of water consumed.
So:
Our solution will increase the efficiency of water use. It will show the current consumption, which will be compared with the consumption in the previous month of this user and similar users (collaborative filtering).
The user will also be able to participate in competitions with friends or family members.
Based on the user's data, our application will recommend him articles that will allow him to learn how to use water correctly.
Using the data, we will also be able to find leaks and improve heating systems.
